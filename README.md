### Purpose: 
Students in today's school often carelessly drop or forget things. So we provide a website to help lost people find lost things and people who find things easily return things to lost people. This is a website that links people who have lost things and people who have picked up lost items.
"Lost and Found" is a Web-based application about students studying at FPT University or lecturers teaching at FPT University. The person who lost the item can find the item he lost and the person who found the lost item can return the item to the lost person.

### User Story: 
As a clumsy, forgetful person, I often accidentally drop, forget things at school, I want to have a website to upload the article I lost something for anyone to see, people can easily find it again. lost person. Normally, if I lose or pick up someone's things, I will go to the FPTU HCM Student facebook group to post, but I have to wait for the article to be reviewed and sometimes the article is lost, making it difficult for me to find it again. Therefore, understanding your heart, Lost and Found was born. Lost and Found is a web app that links lost and recovered people easily and conveniently.
